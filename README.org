This affords a visual way -- besides the filesystem tree -- to group files, or persistently mark files needing action, find a specific file at a glance, etc... I think?  (Honestly I'm not sure.)

*** Features

- There are two supported styles for marking:

A block next to the file name (left), or highlighting (right).  Both styles work with and without =dired-hide-details-mode=.

- Select colors with preview for marking:

*** Installation

**** Manual

Clone this repo or download its files and run =M-x package-install-file= on the directory.

**** Straight

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package dired-delight
  :straight (:host github :repo "karthink/dired-delight")
  :hook (dired-mode . dired-delight-mode)
  :bind (:map dired-mode-map
         ("@" . dired-delight)
         ("*c" . dired-delight-mark-color)))
#+end_src

**** Quelpa

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(package-install 'quelpa-use-package)
(require 'quelpa-use-package)

(use-package dired-delight
  :quelpa (dired-delight :fetcher github :repo "karthink/dired-delight")
  :hook (dired-mode . dired-delight-mode)
  :bind (:map dired-mode-map
         ("@" . dired-delight)
         ("*c" . dired-delight-mark-color)))
#+END_SRC

*** Usage

1. Turn on =dired-delight-mode= in a Dired buffer.
2. Mark files (or not for a single file) and call =dired-delight= to tag marked files.  To remove a tag don't supply any color, i.e. leave it blank.
3. Call =dired-delight-mark-color= to mark all files that have a given color.  You can then narrow the buffer to these files, or act on them in any of the usual ways.

The following keybindings may help:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "@") 'dired-delight)
(define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "*c") 'dired-delight-mark-color)
#+end_src
